The code is for the Thesis titled Abundance of Time Series Modelling of Serengeti Bird Species. 
With the help of this thesis, we aim to study
the interaction between the species and their dependence on one another.
The results can be helpful to predict the abundance and work
on the conservation of the Serengeti bird species. We have used three
different but complementary time series modeling approaches to analyze
the data. Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)
models, Dynamic Regression models, and Bayesian VAR State-Space
models have been used to study the interaction among the five rare and
five most common species found in the Serengeti region. While many
of the species positively interact with each other, many species do not
interact or negatively interact with each other. Both ARIMA and Dynamic
model had similar values of AICs implying that the results of
any of these two models can be relied upon for studying the interaction
among the species. Bayesian VAR model summary shows the interaction
among the species and their abundance over time. This helps to
conclude the abundance of species based on their interaction.
The constant growth in the abundance of a few species can be explained
due to lack of interaction with the species. For e.g, the White Stork has
fair interaction with few species and the abundance can be seen constant
over the years. Few species show an increasing trend in abundance
like the increase in abundance of Grey-Crested Helmetshrike can be explained
by its fair share of interaction with other species. Therefore, the
study of species interaction is important to monitor the abundance for
their conservation.
